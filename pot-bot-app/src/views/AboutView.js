        <h3>The PotBot is a smart plant pot that aims to address the issue of plant care by providing a smart solution
          that promotes optimal plant health and reduces the time and expertise needed for plant care. </h3>
        <h3>Using sensors, the PotBot regularly checks the levels of soil moisture, temperature, and light exposure of
          the userâ€™s plant, which the user can monitor remotely through the official application. </h3>
        <h3>In case of watering needs, the user can opt for automatic watering, made possible with a built-in watering
          system and when the plant is in need of care, the user is notified about the environmental data. </h3>
        <h3>Through the official application, the user can access all their PotBots and monitor and interact with all
          their plants from a single application. In addition, the PotBot helps promote optimal plant health by
          providing real-time monitoring and care suggestions, ultimately leading to healthier and more vibrant
          plants.</h3>
