## Background
The idea behind this project is to create a smart plant pot that can automatically water plants, while also measuring and recording various environmental factors to ensure optimal plant growth. Here's a breakdown of each of the proposed features:

Automatic Plant Watering:
The smart plant pot will use sensors to detect the soil moisture levels and will water the plant automatically when the soil becomes too dry. This will ensure that the plant is always well hydrated without the need for manual watering.

Light Level Monitoring:
The smart plant pot will also measure and record the light levels around the plant, which is important for plant growth. The sensor can be placed at the top of the pot to measure the intensity of the light that the plant is receiving, and can be used to adjust the position of the pot to ensure that the plant is getting enough light.

Soil Moisture Monitoring:
The smart plant pot will measure and record the soil moisture levels, which is important to prevent over or under watering. The sensor can be placed in the soil and will detect the moisture content of the soil, providing data that can be used to trigger the automatic watering feature.

Temperature Monitoring:
The smart plant pot will also measure and record the temperature around the plant, which is important for plant growth. The sensor can be placed at the top of the pot to measure the ambient temperature and can be used to adjust the position of the pot to ensure that the plant is not exposed to extreme temperatures.

Overall, the smart plant pot will provide a convenient way to ensure that plants are healthy and thriving, without the need for constant monitoring and manual intervention. The data collected by the various sensors can also be used to analyze and optimize plant growth over time.
